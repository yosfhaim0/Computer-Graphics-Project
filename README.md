A program to create 3D images with special effects such as soft shadow and field depth
(ie, some of the image is sharp and some of the image blurred) 
this optional option of frozen objects or objects like water means that their reflection is a bit blurry.

The program has a lot of fields: color, geometry, algebra, photography, architecture, etc.

The program contains vectors and points created by the programmer rather than modules reserved in the work environment.
