# Computer-Graphics-Project
Computer Graphics 

The project in an introduction to software engineering at the Academic Institute, the first 8 parts are 
instructions for creating the project whit order form lecturer and the latest parts give more free hand for students, 
at all stages of the project, all bonuses were made.

A program to create 3D images with special effects such as soft shadow and field depth
(ie, some of the image is sharp and some of the image blurred) 
this optional option of frozen objects or objects like water means that their reflection is a bit blurry.

The program has a lot of fields: color, geometry, algebra, photography, architecture, etc.

The program contains vectors and points created by the programmer rather than modules reserved in the work environment.

 Examples of images  Depth of the field including anti aliasing
